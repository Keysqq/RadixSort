Radix Sort

This script will implement a radix sort using a count sort as a sub routine.
An array with length of 100 is first set up.
Then the array is filled with random integers ranged from 0-100
This array is first displayed to show its contents and order
The array is then passed into the radix sort function
Radix sort is used, using a base concept of first checking the least significant digit starting from the ones place and working up(10s,100s)
Once the array has been sorted it is then again displayed

Program was set up using a range from 0-100 over 0-1000 for output readability sake

The design implements some driver code were the array and random ints are set up as well as a method call to the sorting algorithm

Testing did include labeling the output/ arrray entries so to view the actual order.
